Steps to get ILA Core to trigger (???)

Fix error: 
[Labtools 27-1395] Unable to arm ILA 'hw_ila_1'. The core clock is slow or no core clock connected for this ILA or the ILA core may not meet timing.

***SOLVED:***
MUST PROGRAM FPGA Initially with all DIP Switches DOWN


Steps taken:
1) Open original rtl tutorial design from 4dsp, re-upgrade IP, generate bit file, open new hardware target, program
2) start fpga with all DIP switches DOWN -- then move up
3) Remove added probe 7
4) WTF??
